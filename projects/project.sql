/*
INSIGHTS
1)
  -The Students table captures essential student information, like names, email addresses, and phone numbers.
  -The Courses table holds data on courses available across different departments.
  -The Enrollments table is central to understanding which students are enrolled in which courses.
  -The Grades table provides critical insights into student performance, linking students with their grades in individual courses.
  
2)
The enrollment data shows that some students are enrolled in multiple courses, such as John Doe, who is taking both "Database Systems" and 
"Mathematics 101," while others are only enrolled in one course. This can help identify students with heavier course loads.

3)
By joining the Enrollments and Courses tables, you can easily query the courses a specific student is enrolled in, 
providing detailed information about each studentâ€™s academic choices. Similarly, by joining the Grades and Courses tables, 
you can get detailed insights into a student's academic performance in each course.

4)
Analyzing the number of students in each course reveals which courses are popular and which have fewer students.
For example, "Database Systems" has two students enrolled, while other courses like "Physics 101" and "Chemistry 101"
have just one student each.

5)
The data shows that John Doe is the only student enrolled in more than one course, suggesting he might have a more diverse academic focus.

6)
The queries reveal that students like John Doe and Jane Smith are enrolled in the Computer Science department, which could help determine
the most engaged students in a particular field.

7)
Through the Grades table, you can quickly identify students who have not received an 'A' grade in any course. 
This insight could guide academic interventions, such as offering extra tutoring etc.

8)
The query that provides a total number of courses each student is enrolled in shows that most students are enrolled in a single course, 
while John Doe is taking two.This insight could indicate that students are taking a lighter course load.
